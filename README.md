### Optional - Run Server
In order to fully install the app you will need to run the server side.
* Server - https://github.com/roystern92/tasks_server.git

## Reflection

I started by using  the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router`. I used `redux` in order to centralized the application state and `redux-thunk` for handling asynchronous services from the redux store. I used `axios` for handling requests from the client to the server. I created most of the UI component that are used in this project and styled them so i can reuse them in a future projects.    

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, Bootstrap, ReactStrap, ReactScroll, ReactContextMenu and a significant amount of CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.

## Built With
